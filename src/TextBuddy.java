/**
*
* This program is used to manipulate text files. The user runs the java program with a command line argument
* that is the name of the file the user wishes to manipulate. The program allows for 5 operations:
*      1. Add: a line is appended at the end to the text file, followed by a new line.
*      2. Delete: the line specified by the user is deleted
*      3. Clear: all content in the text file is deleted
*      4. Display: the file contents are displayed to the user, and each line marked with its line number
*      5. Sort: the file contents are sorted in alphabetical order, and saved immediately to the file.
*      6: Search: if the word supplied can be found in the text, the lines and their respective line number
*      will be displayed to the user. If not found, the user will be alerted.
*      7. Exit: the program exits
*
*
* The file is saved to disk after every user operation that modifies the text e.g. add, delete and clear.
* This is the most intuitive way, since it takes considerable effort on the user's part to issue a command,
* it is likely that the user wants the command to registered. The only downside here is that the user
* might have accidentally deleted a line, due to accidental number input.
*
* These are some of the assumptions made:
* 1. The command line argument supplied to the program is of .txt format.
* 2. The add command followed by a space is treated as invalid argument.
* 3. The delete command followed by a space, or a number that is more than the total number of lines, or
* a string are treated as an invalid arguments.
