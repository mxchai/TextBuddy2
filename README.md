## TextBuddy v2

This program is used to manipulate text files. The user runs the java program with a command line argument that is the name of the file the user wishes to manipulate. The program allows for 5 operations:

1. **Add**: a line is appended at the end to the text file, followed by a new line.
2. **Delete**: the line specified by the user is deleted
3. **Clear**: all content in the text file is deleted
4. **Display**: the file contents are displayed to the user, and each line marked with its line number
5. **Sort**: the file contents are sorted in alphabetical order, and saved immediately to the file.
6: **Search**: if the word supplied can be found in the text, the lines and their respective line number will be displayed to the user. If not found, the user will be alerted.
7. **Exit**: the program exits
